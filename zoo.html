              Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are
              classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight
              species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide
              variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and
              partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the
              continents of North America, South America, and Eurasia. Common
              characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs,
              long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with
              five nonretractile claws, and short tails.

              The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus
              Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
              ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one
              species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently,
              researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due
              to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as
              morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are
              known from the fossil record.

              The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to
              Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short,
              rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It
              is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and
              have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called
              prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females,
              and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly
              on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator;
              although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been
              known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and
              prey on humans.

              Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the
              infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. Traditionally, all
              animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys
              except the apes, which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic
              grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes
              (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians
              synonyms in regard to their scope.

            An alligator, or colloquially gator, is a large reptile in the
            Crocodilia order in the genus Alligator of the family Alligatoridae.
            The two extant species are the American alligator (A.
            mississippiensis) and the Chinese alligator (A. sinensis).
            Additionally, several extinct species of alligator are known from
            fossil remains. Alligators first appeared during the Oligocene epoch
            about 37 million years ago.
